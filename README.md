This project requires a Firebase database. See `.env.sample` for the required environment variables.

## Creating a firebase real-time database

- Create a Firebase account if you do not have one.
- Head to the firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com/, and add a new project. Select web-based when prompted.
- Once the project is created, create a Real-Time Database (there should be an option to do so on the main project page)
- In order to get the environment variables to put in a `.env` file, go to the project settings and scroll down to "Your Applications". You should see some integration code there. Copy the configuration values and paste them into a .env file:
